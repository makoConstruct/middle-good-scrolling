Description: Better mouse scrolling for Linux
 A better way of scrolling for mice. Makes it so that clicking your chosen
 mouse button and dragging (anywhere on the page) is like clicking and
 dragging the scrollbar handle.
 .
 Features:
  * Bind scrolling to a comfortable button (forward button by default)
  * Smoother and less rigid than libinput's middle-click scroll
  * Supports horizontal/biaxial scrolling
  * Only absorbs button clicks if you begin a drag
  * Highly configurable via /etc/defter-scrolling.conf
 .
 This systemd service runs in the background to intercept mouse events
 and provide an improved scrolling experience.
